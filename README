This repository contains an example project with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and Nginx as a reverse proxy to connect the two.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **frontend**: Contains the React-based web application.
- **backend**: Contains the FastAPI backend server.
- **nginx**: Configuration files for Nginx as a reverse proxy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for running the React app.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) for running the FastAPI backend.
- [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) for serving as a reverse proxy.
